\begin{abstract}
    In this paper, we propose a perspective on the realization of a general and autonomous artificial researcher. First, we discuss the definition of research to clarify the goal we pursue. Second, we review existing literature of research automation to know our current standing point. Third, based on these discussions, we propose what we should to realize a general and autonomous artificial researcher.

\chapter{Additional Literature Review}

\chapter{Alignment}
Understanding is subjective, so there is a need to consider alignment. Even if the process of hypothesis generation is incomprehensible to humans, as long as the verification is connected to fundamental human beliefs, it can be said to be knowledge based on a common foundation with humans.

\chapter{Research Optimization}

\chapter{Research as Social Activity}
In this paper, we will discuss automation focused on the unique elements of knowledge production as mentioned above. However, research is a social endeavor. And that society has various levels, such as research labs, universities, and research ecosystems. Therefore, if we think about optimizing the whole activity of research, we need to think about optimizing these wholes. Although it is out of the scope of this paper and therefore not discussed this time, we would like to discuss this in the future.

\chapter{Research as Belief Update}

From the perspective that research is belief updating, the roles of question construction, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis verification can be represented in the following Fig. \ref{fig:beliefupdate}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/beliefupdate.jpg}
    \caption{Research Process as Belief Update}
    \label{fig:beliefupdate}
\end{figure}
In the diagram, circles represent statements, and squares represent beliefs in response to those statements. Note that while circles were described as statements, they are not limited to textual representations as long as they are associated with beliefs. Beliefs are determined by the subject holding the belief (in this case, an agent) and the object of the belief (the statement), but please note that we are assuming a fixed agent in this context.

Firstly, in this world, there exist countless pairs of statements and corresponding beliefs (or latent beliefs). Posing a question corresponds to extracting a subset of unknown statements from this pool. More precisely, an unknown statement refers to a statement for which the agent is unsure whether to assign a strong or weak belief. Choosing corresponds to implicitly determining a function that assigns beliefs to each statement. For example, let's consider posing the question ``When did the universe begin?'' This answer to this question is unknown to humanity. By posing this question, the range of possible answers is narrowed down. However, it is not realistically possible for an agent to be aware of all statements and potential answers that could exist. Therefore, while we mentioned pairs of beliefs and statements, please consider that most of these beliefs are latent and potential.

Next, generating a hypothesis involves selecting one pair of a claim and a belief from among the potential claims that could serve as potential answers to the question. It is at this point, by choosing a hypothesis or considering multiple candidate hypotheses, that discourse becomes consciously acknowledged, and beliefs are substantively assigned. Finally, as we discussed in Chapter 2, verification involves gaining evidence for the belief in the chosen hypothesis, resulting in the updating of the belief state. The updated beliefs are represented in black in the diagram.
