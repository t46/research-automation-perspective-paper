\section{Pursuing Better Research}
Please emphasize once again that what I are aiming for is to achieve a better way of knowledge production. The realization of general and autonomous artificial intelligence is a means to that end. Therefore, even if certain research practices are widely adopted at present, I will strive for better methods if they are not essential for knowledge production and if there are superior alternatives. In other words, I propose to pursue the realization of artificial intelligence that enables a different and improved way of knowledge production, rather than simply automating the current research practices.

While the practices of research developed by humans are highly sophisticated, robust, and productive, it is not necessarily true that all of them have reached the absolute optimum way of doing research. Firstly, research practices are strongly influenced by history and society. For example, peer review is widely accepted today, but it is said to have gained such dominant status because foundations in Cold War-era U.S. demanded peer review to ensure accountability \cite{baldwin2018scientific}. Moreover, the fact that research outcomes are still represented in the form of papers is clearly a remnant of the era when print was predominant. These practices might have been optimal under the social conditions and technologies of that time, but they may not necessarily be optimal in the present, as society has changed a lot. Additionally, meeting societal demands does not always lead to the optimization of knowledge production. Secondly, it seems that I sometimes lack a widely shared understanding of how to optimally carry out certain aspects of research. For instance, it is important to formulate good research questions and hypotheses, but there are still many aspects about how to do this effectively that remain unclear, and it appears to rely heavily on individuals' tacit knowledge. In such a situation, simply replacing current practices with machines may not guarantee a good knowledge production process. Thirdly, as Nielsen and Qiu say \cite{nielsen}, it is believed that I have only explored in a very limited subspace in the space of possible research practices. The establishment of current research practices is a very recent event in human history, and I may not yet have arrived at the optimum way of research. \textcolor{red}{TODO: Add examples.} Finally, as I mentioned above, current research assumes that humans are the main creators and consumers of knowledge. This naturally imposes human cognitive constraints, which may significantly limit the range of activities that can be conducted for knowledge production. Based on these reasons, I aim to progress the discussion in a way that allows us to identify what is fundamentally essential for knowledge production, while also drawing inspiration from the positive aspects of past practices. I will not be bound by the current approaches but instead strive to clarify what is truly crucial for research.

\section{Call for Cooperation}
I would be delighted if all of you could contribute to writing this research paper. The initial draft of this paper was created by a novice machine learning researcher named OO. I have made efforts to write the text as carefully as possible, but due to his limited research experience, He may not be able to provide profound insights into the topic, and there might be inaccuracies in his understanding of fields that are not his expertise. In particular, the literature review chapter prioritizes comprehensive coverage of the literature, which means that the evaluation of individual references might not be appropriate. Also, there are naturally limitations and biases regarding the scope of papers that can be covered and the research areas targeted. Therefore, if you find any errors, missed literature, or points for improvement in the paper, I would be grateful if you could let us know.



\section{Towards Understanding this Universe}
It has been a long-standing goal of humanity to understand nature, the universe, and the world. Through this intellectual curiosity, mankind has made remarkable intellectual advancements and uncovered astonishing findings about nature. While perfect understanding of this universe may be infeasible, the desire to know as much as possible about as many things as possible in this universe is a shared sentiment among researchers.

However, it seems that there are limitations to achieving this goal solely through current human capabilities. This is because humans have several cognitive constraints when it comes to understanding phenomena. For instance, there is a limit to the amount of information humans can process, and comprehending highly complex, nonlinear, and non-equilibrium systems in their entirety is challenging. Such constraints appear to narrow the scope of nature that can be understood. \textcolor{red}{TODO: update the explanation of cognitive limitation}

Furthermore, there is a possibility that the methodologies of knowledge production employed by humans currently may not be optimal. This is because the research practices I have developed are heavily influenced by historical and societal factors. Many of these practices have emerged in a relatively short span of history, and there is still a vast unexplored territory in the methods of conducting research.

We believe that artificial intelligence capable of autonomously conducting all research holds great potential in overcoming these challenges and getting closer to the goal. Firstly, AI is not constrained by a physical device like the human brain, enabling processing speeds and capacities that are orders of magnitude beyond human capabilities \cite{hope2022computational,kitano2021nobel}. Secondly, by optimizing AI for knowledge production, it becomes possible to generate knowledge more efficiently, without being constrained by extraneous factors commonly encountered in human research. Lastly, and most importantly, AI has the potential to possess a different understanding of nature compared to humans. Moreover, AI might have the capacity to comprehend nature more extensively than humans. If that's the case, it seems essential to develop autonomously researching artificial intelligence if one aims to acquire as much knowledge as possible about this universe. Therefore, I propose the pursuit of autonomous AI researchers to realize these possibilities.

\section{Objectivity of Research}

The objectivity of research seems to arise from such demand that knowledge should be for humanity. Because of this requirement, researchers conduct research with extreme precision and caution. This serves as one of the justifications for the knowledge produced through research being reliable. I admit that finding the basis of objectivity of research is a challenging philosophical issue. Please note that what I have stated here is merely the humble intuition.

Seeking public accessibility in knowledge implies that the expressions of knowledge and the process of knowledge production should be understandable to everyone. For instance, in human societies, knowledge is often expressed with texts. This is because language serves as a highly universal means of conveying information that a significant number of people can comprehend and handle. Similarly, the process of knowledge production is also conveyed through language.


\chapter{Chapter Title}
\section{Scope of the Discussion}
I think that the activities related to research can be broadly divided into two phases: the process of knowledge production, typically in the form of papers or other publications, and the phase of maintaining, sharing, evaluating, and utilizing the knowledge. While the latter phase is a crucial aspect of knowledge, it will not be addressed here since the focus of this paper is on knowledge production. 

However, it's important to note that the distinction between the two phases is not strictly delineated. For instance, the value and usage of knowledge in a society would influence the production process of it, and research evaluation and revision are ongoing even after the knowledge is produced into the society. Thus, evaluation of the value of knowledge may not be completely exclude from my discussion simply because they mainly take place after knowledge production. As such, I will make sure to touch upon elements that are not always necessary for knowledge. 

Furthermore, factors influenced by social constraints such as funding acquisition and collaboration agreements that typically occur before the research are not addressed in this paper. Knowledge production can be seen as a function that produces knowledge from inputs such as people, capital, resources, and information. Viewing it this way, the acquisition of money or human capital can be considered inputs to the function rather than the knowledge production itself. Thus, I do not touch on this topic in this chapter. I admit that these factors are also crucial elements in the pursuit of true autonomy in research, so they will be subject to future discussions. Also, even if it is information acquisition, if that is strongly related to the internal of knowledge production itself, I will address it later in this paper. 

In conclusion, the following text focuses on the process of research, where knowledge is output as research outcomes given any input. For simplicity, I will refer to this process as the \textit{knowledge production system} or just \textit{research process}. It is worth reiterating that this distinction is provisional, intended to facilitate further discussion and the development of better categorizations or broader automation in the future.

\end{figure}

\section{Research as Information Processing System}
Knowledge production system can be seen as an information processing system.\footnote{My discussion here is influenced by David Marr's three levels  \cite{marr2010vision}, although it is not exactly the same.} First of all, all information procesing systems have an objective and achieve that objective by processing inputs. In current case, the objective in research is to produce a new knowledge for a society. The reason I divided the research process into the question construction, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis verification is equivalent to breaking down this information processing into three sub-modules. Each of these three sub-modules is also an information processing system with its own objective. For example, the objective of the question construction module is to discover unknown knowledge.

When I have mention in this section that I would focus on the parts functionally related to knowledge production, it have meant two things. The first is to ensure that the objectives of these sub-modules are essential sub-objectives in all research. As mentioned earlier, these modules should not be something that works for history research but not for mathematics research. I should consider modules that have objective essential to all research for realizing general artificial researcher. Additionally, the process of peer review, while relevant to knowledge production, was considered to be a process of judging the ``value of knowledge'' and so was not included in the knowledge production system. The second point is that the my discussion is limited to the objective of the modules and not about the specific representation of information or the specific algorithms for information processing within the modules. For example, reading and writing papers are currently universally necessary for any research. However, a paper is just one of all representations of information, and there could be alternative representations (e.g., blogs). Moreover, while one person may conduct experiments using rats to verify a hypothesis, another person may present historical records showing statements from deceased individuals that match the hypothesis. These are different methods of verification, but both serve the purpose of verification.

\section{Between the Knowledge Production System and Society}
In this section, I will discuss how peer review is related to knowledge production. The reason for discussing peer review is primarily because it is a widely practiced convention across various fields. I will discuss the role of peer review as a kind of membrane that spans both the preceding knowledge production and the subsequent knowledge utilization. I will also explore the possibility that the redundancy in the functions of peer review has played an essential role in the knowledge production of human societies. Lastly, I will discuss the implications of these conclusion for research automation.

% Peer review is a social convention developed in human societies.

% whether it is necessary or not for research, it is impossible to avoid discussing something that has been so widely accepted when considering research automation. 



\subsection{Peer Review}
In current research, a small group of experts review papers and the results that pass through their review are published. This process is called \textit{peer review}. Peer review is now considered an indispensable practice in research across a wide range of fields.

Peer review, particularly pre-publication peer review, is commonly regarded as playing the role of a gatekeeper of knowledge, determining what becomes knowledge and what does not. It enables the production of high-quality knowledge by assessing the quality before publication. Here, let's delve a bit deeper and examine the specific role that peer review plays in knowledge production.

\subsubsection{Epistemic Value Evaluation}

We believe that peer review serves two distinct roles in knowledge production. The first role is evaluating the fulfillment of necessary conditions for the knowledge of a research. This involves assessing aspects such as the validity of the methodologies used and the sufficiency of the content's novelty. 

This process could potentially be skipped if these evaluations were flawlessly conducted in every research endeavor during the knowledge production process. In that sense, I can say that peer review is redundant as a function for knowledge production, as it duplicates the functionality of what researchers have already done. If this process is merely redundant, does it mean that this process is unnecessary?

We would say that redundancy has played an important role in human knowledge production. Firstly, humans naturally make mistakes and have blind spots that they may not be aware of. It seems important to enhance the reliability of the produced knowledge by detecting such oversights with multiple checks. Secondly, research is fundamentally conducted on the assumption of goodwill, making it important to have a process to verify if any misconduct or ethical issues have occurred for the sake of a healthy knowledge production. Having a mechanism for third-party evaluation can be considered a deterrent against fraudulent activities. Lastly, as emphasized repeatedly in this paper, verification is an act of updating collective beliefs. Therefore, the existence of a process to confirm whether the verified results are acknowledged by others seems essential in the context of knowledge production for that society. Considering these factors, I believe that the first point, which functionally exhibits redundancy, has played an important role in human knowledge production.

\subsubsection{Non-Epistemic Value Evaluation}

The second role is about evaluating whether a proposed study has ``value'' to the research community and society. This involves judging factors such as the importance of the research, its clarity, and its ethical validity, etc. This function is obviously important as knowledge from research is supposed to be used by the research community and society.

This evaluation pertains to the submitted knowledge rather than the process of knowledge production itself. In a sense, it can be seen as an anticipatory assessment of the value judgments that will be made when the knowledge is disseminated in society. In other words, just as peer review was considered a redundant process in knowledge production for the first role, peer review can also be seen as a redundant process in terms of the judgments made on knowledge disseminated in society.

One role of redundancy in such judgments of social value would be to reduce the number of research results that knowledge consumers need to pay attention to. This has played an important role in human knowledge production, given the cognitive constraints of the limited number of papers that humans can process.

\subsubsection{Peer Review as a Redundant Membrane}

In summary, the first role can be interpreted as an extension of the knowledge production process, while the second role can be seen as a pre-emptive value judgment by society. In other words, the act of peer review serves as a redundant membrane that connects the process leading to the production of knowledge with the subsequent processes of knowledge use. \footnote{
In peer review, it is customary to assess whether there is sufficient information to reproduce the research. This evaluation of research reproducibility can be considered, in a sense, an assessment of its epistemic value. This is because, instead of evaluating the validity of verification through replication at that moment, the request for reproducible information aims to leave the possibility of future verification.
} Inspired by the words of Seetl, I can say that the former role is the judgement of \textit{epistemic value} and the later is that of \textit{non-epistemic value} \cite{steel2010epistemic}. 

Here, epistemic value refers to properties that are intrinsically important to knowledge production, such as necessary conditions for knowledge production. For example, I will call judging the validity of verification a judgment of epistemic value in the sense that it leads to judging whether the activity can be called knowledge production or not. 

The term non-epistemic value, on the other hand, is used in this paper to mean a value without which the legitimacy of knowledge production would not be affected. For example, if a knowledge production process were unethical, what it produced would still be knowledge, but it would be non-epistemic value in the sense that it is important to society. The readability or ``importance'' of a paper is also a use value of knowledge per se, but it has nothing to do with the legitimacy of knowledge production, so I call it a non-epistemic value. When I simply refer to ``value'' in this paper, I are referring to this no-epistemic value.

    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{figs/peer_review.jpg}
    \caption{Peer Review}
    \label{fig:peer_review}
\end{figure}

As an example, I show the review criteria of Nature in table \ref{tab:nature_review}. Each criterion is classified into epistemic value (evaluation of whether it fulfills the necessary conditions for knowledge production) and non-epistemic value (evaluation of whether it holds some value within the research community or society). From this example, it becomes evident that in peer review, research outcomes are evaluated from both epistemic and non-epistemic perspectives.

\subsubsection{Implications for Research Automation}

If peer review is considered redundant in knowledge production, then the necessity of the peer review process when conducting research with artificial intelligence, which may have fewer cognitive constraints than humans, becomes a topic of discussion. If there are no occurrences of human errors, it may not be necessary to have a redundant process. So is peer review simply a social product of human cognitive constraints, or does it play an important role in knowledge production even in automated research?

We believe the importance of redundant valuations will not be lost in automated research. First, regarding the function of detecting oversights, automating research may eliminate certain types of mistakes, but overlooking aspects is still possible. For instance, as mentioned earlier, it is impossible to enumerate all the assumptions involved in the research process. Review could help by identifying relevant assumptions that need consideration, potentially altering the implications of the validation results. Second, against malicious injustice, this also happens in the automated research as well. There is a possibility of creating artificially intelligent researchers that could maliciously manipulate and engage in fraudulent activities. Furthermore, in the ultimate stage of full autonomy, as pointed out in alignment research, there is a potential for machines to deceive humans as well. Also, since the goal remains the same, whether the research is done by humans or by machines, to update joint beliefs, it is just as important that it is actually evaluated by other members of society. Finally, in the first place, the nature of research is that hypotheses are continually subjected to constant testing. As mentioned earlier, a hypothesis tested by inductive reasoning cannot be declared true in the same way that deduction can. It is common for the knowledge to be later discovered to be erroneous or merged with other new knowledge. Therefore, it seems to me that this redundant process of criticism is essential for research, and should not even be imposed on a single process of peer review. For these reasons, it would seem that redundant evaluation from a third-party perspective should somehow be accomplished even in automated studies.

From a slightly different perspective, aiming to automate peer review of papers may be a useful first step toward generic and autonomous research automation. This is because peer review involves judgments about the validity of verification, as well as judgments and novelty determinations, factors that I have emphasized as important in research automation. Moreover, while finding novelty and performing validation are generative tasks, this is an classification task, and in that sense it is an easier task. Similarly, I pointed out that it is important to inculcate the value of what is important to the research community if I want machines to construct ``important'' questions. Determining non-epistemic values in peer review can be thought of as an classification task for these elements, and may help us clarify the issues to realize artificial research. In addition, peer review requires similar evaluation criteria regardless of the particular discipline. For these reasons, if I aim to automate the peer review of papers, I may in the process better clarify the elements necessary to realize a general and autonomous artificial researcher.

\subsubsection{Towards a Better System}
We do not believe it is necessary to automate current peer review practices as they are, because what is needed is a redundant evaluation function, and the current practice contains more historical and social influences than that. For example, researchers now almost always employ pre-publication peer review, but there are issues raised regarding this pre-publication peer review \cite{heesen2021peer}. Instead, a system that continuously evaluates all research findings during the process and after the production of results, continuously updating knowledge, may lead to more robust and high-quality knowledge production. Also, although I currently do peer-review by a small number of experts, it would naturally be more robust if more agents participated in the evaluation.

It is also no exaggeration to say that in the current function of peer review, researchers place the greatest importance on the function of screening for submission to good journals. But this has nothing to do with epistemic value and is a practice that I do not think needs to be retained.

We believe that the culture of submitting to top journals plays the following role in research. First, it serves to lower the cost to the reader in determining which papers to read. By prioritizing results from well-known journal brands, it means that they can read the more important papers first. However, if judgments of non-epistemic value were automated, so that machines could directly judge the value of research, then indirect value judgments via brands would no longer be necessary. More to the point, if the readers of papers are turning into machines, they will be able to process a much larger volume of papers than humans, and the selection of papers to read in the first place may not be as important as it used to be. The second role is to help researchers evaluate their work. It can help third parties determine that a researcher with papers in top journals is probably a researcher of a certain level of ability. This has been a strong incentive for researchers to submit papers to top journals in order to find good careers in the tight academic job market, to prove that they are decent researchers, and to satisfy their own sense of honor. However, this function will become less important when the subject of research becomes a machine. Therefore, it seems desirable to move away from the function of reviewing papers for submission to good journals, which is currently the most dominant function, and move toward optimizing the evaluation of epistemic values and direct evaluation of non-epistemic values.

Although peer-review is well prevalent research practice, it is said that peer review became commonplace like today only from the 1970s onwards \cite{baldwin2018scientific}. Also, as I explained in Chapter 1, it emerged just as a response to the demanded to ensure accountability in society \cite{baldwin2018scientific}. Therefore, I can say that the practice of peer review is still in its infancy, and I should be able to come up with a more optimized way of being that removes constraints that are not related to knowledge production. Thus, I should look for a better automated system that takes over the role that peer review plays.

% The review evaluates papers from multiple different perspectives. For example, at NeurIPS 2022, papers are evaluated based on the criterias of originality, quality, clarity, and significance.

% I would say that redundancy has played an important role in human knowledge production. Firstly, humans naturally make mistakes and have blind spots that they may not be aware of, so multiple checks hold significant value. Automating research may eliminate certain types of mistakes, but overlooking aspects is still possible. For instance, as mentioned earlier, it is impossible to enumerate all the assumptions involved in the research process. However, critics could help by identifying relevant assumptions that need consideration, potentially altering the implications of the validation results.

% Additionally, research is fundamentally conducted on the assumption of goodwill, making it important to have a process to verify if any misconduct or ethical issues have occurred for the sake of a healthy knowledge production.

Furthermore, in the ultimate stage of full autonomy, as pointed out in alignment discussions, there is a potential for machines to deceive humans as well.

% Lastly, as emphasized repeatedly in this paper, verification is an act of updating collective beliefs. Therefore, the existence of a process to confirm whether the verified results are acknowledged by others seems essential in the context of knowledge production for that society. Considering these factors, I believe that the first point, which functionally exhibits redundancy, plays an important role in knowledge production.


\section{Techniques for Knowledge Production}

In this section, I will discuss the ``techniques'' commonly used in research. Because they are techniques, they are not objective of modules in knowledge production system. However, they play an extremely universal and significant role in knowledge production across various fields in current human knowledge production. 

In particular, I will discuss \textit{information retrieval}, \textit{literacy}, \textit{data analysis}, and \textit{deductive reasoning}. If there is absolutely no access to any information whatsoever, knowledge production is considered impossible. Research, like other activities, requires acquiring information. Therefore, techniques for information retrieval, including searching and questioning, are essential in research across various fields. In particular, research builds upon existing knowledge, often in the form of research papers, to generate new knowledge. Thus, I will pay particular attention on scholarly literature search. 

The second aspect is literacy, the ability to read and write texts. In human society, I express many kinds of information in text. Therefore, the ability to read documents is inherently important in information acquisition. Additionally, I express knowledge through the generation of papers, which serve as a medium of knowledge. Thus, writing texts also matters for knowledge production. These discussions revolve around the ``representation'' of knowledge and information, which are constrained by societal practices. However, without these skills, conducting research in human society would be impossible, making them necessary abilities across all fields. Hence, I will discuss reading and writing skills. 

The third aspect is data analysis. As mentioned earlier, a significant portion of research is empirical. Data analysis is essential in the process of constructing questions from observations, in generating the next hypothesis from the results of an experiment, and in deriving an interpretation of the verification results from the data generated for hypothesis verification. Therefore, data analysis is a necessary skill regardless of the research field. 

The fourth aspect is deductive or systematic reasoning. This is essential in mathematics and natural sciences and is required across various fields in the natural sciences. Therefore, I will revisit this topic for further discussion. 

Although all of these are indispensable in current research, they should be consciously distinguished as ``techniques'' or ``methods'' aimed at achieving the ``purpose'' of question construction, hypothesis generation or hypothesis verification. As I told before, I pay careful attention to making this distinction. There are many important techniques in research that were not covered here. The ones discussed are only a small fraction, and they were touched upon briefly in this paper. It would be highly significant to have broader and more detailed discussions about the crucial techniques in research, as it would further advance research automation.

\subsection{Information Retrieval}
A simplified research process is a function that outputs knowledge, given an input. However, in reality, to execute every single individual process in knowledge production, it is necessary to collect information from the world and use them as inputs. For example, to construct a research question, one may need to search for academic papers. Similarly, to evaluate the performance of a proposed algorithm, one may need to acquire a benchmark dataset. In this way, research can be seen as an act of producing knowledge by taking in all the information from the world as inputs. Therefore, it is not an overstatement to say that information retrieval is an essential technique in knowledge production. 

Hope et al. have proposed a similar but more sophisticated depiction of this view in their perspective paper \cite{hope2022computational}. They regard the research as an interaction between a researcher’s inner cognitive world and the outer world and emphasize the importance of knowledge retrieval aligned with human cognitive world. Although the equivalent of the inner world in this paper is not the human cognitive world but the knowledge production system, the perspective of distinguishing between the external source of information and actual knowledge production mechanism shares similarities.

Information retrieval is a major topic with a long history and the scope it covers is extensive. Therefore, I will not discuss information retrieval research per se, but only those that may be directly relevant to the automation of research. However, even when limited to those related to research, information retrieval is a highly flexible topic as the methods for it vary depending on the research subject. For example, retrieving publicly available data that can be used for research, or in the case of machine learning, retrieving models, is also information retrieval. Therefore, our discussion here will focus first on scholarly literature retrieval, which is generally required for almost all research, among research-specific information retrieval. Subsequently, I will expand the discussion to implications for research automation in general.
% models that involve computer operations, including browser manipulation, and explore the implications they have on research automation.

\subsubsection{Scholarly Literature Retrieval}
% \textcolor{red}{TODO: Change}
Research is an endeavor to create knowledge based on existing research. Therefore, the first step is to obtain the existing literature that is deemed necessary by conducting a scholarly literature search. A bibliographic search is an attempt to retrieve the scholarly articles that best meet a given requirement.

As you can see from the above description, the construction of the aforementioned literature-based question is an example of a scholarly literature search. Therefore, what I basically need to do is 1. search for articles 2. make a judgment on the articles. In the construction of the question, I determined whether or not the article is an unknown study, but this determination depends on the purpose of conducting an academic literature search. For example, you may be searching for a paper to refer to previous experiments conducted for a similar purpose when planning a validation project. Or you may be looking for papers to identify recent research trends.

In determining whether a paper is useful for your purpose, you need to understand the contents of the paper to varying degrees. This seems to call for two things immediately. The first is obviously an understanding of language (in the case of human society), and the second is an understanding of the thesis. Since these are important issues, I will discuss them in the next section on literacy.

This was the case of direct acquisition of academic bibliographic information, but if that knowledge is stored as tacit knowledge in a large-scale artificial intelligence, the same consequences as discussed in the question construction section will result. If I can directly obtain the desired information by giving instructions to a machine that has accumulated a large amount of article data, the search, reading, and decision making will become an end-to-end process. I have already discussed this point, so I will not discuss it in detail here.

% Research is an endeavor to create knowledge based on existing studies. Therefore, the first step is to search for papers that should be read. 

% To find the necessary papers, you have to know what is written in each paper. Therefore, \textit{search} is closely related to \textit{reading}, which will be discussed in the next section. Here, For convenience, I will distinguish between the two: the former refers to finding the necessary papers from a large collection of papers, and the latter refers to extracting necessary information from the obtained single paper.

% I shall make mention of the relationship between these concepts and the activity commonly referred to as a \textit{survey}. I define the survey as a series of processes of 1. searching for necessary papers, 2. extracting information from multiple papers, and 3. comparing them to make some kind of decision. Please note that comparison, searching, and reading are all closely related to each other in this context as well; for instance, proper comparison between papers is necessary for better searching.

% The distinction between the aforementioned tasks of reading and searching, as well as the definition of survey, are based solely on the fact that I humans distinguish between them. However, if desired information could be directly obtained through natural language instructions from a large set of academic paper data, the tasks of searching, reading, and comparison would become an end-to-end process. Thanks to the remarkable development of large-scale language models in recent years, such a possibility has become a realistic one. Further details on this possibility will be discussed later.

\subsubsection{Implications for Research Automation}
As the discussion so far has shown, information retrieval depends on 1. the purpose of the information retrieval and 2. the representation of the information to be retrieved. From the first point, it seems necessary to first understand what kind of information retrieval is typically required in research in order to realize the most general-purpose information retrieval method possible in research automation. As I have discussed, research is considered to consist of question formulation, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis testing, so it is important to discuss what kind of information retrieval is required to achieve these objectives. On the other hand, as I saw in the section on hypothesis testing, a considerable degree of freedom is required in the execution of testing. It seems to me that it would be extremely difficult to achieve a unified information retrieval method that includes all of these factors.

The second point also seems to pose a major challenge. It would be fine if the structure of information were highly standardized, as in the case of a paper, but there is a great variety of data and model representation formats and their storage locations, for example. Since the efficiency of search depends on the representation and nature of the search target, it is a difficult task to realize the uniform and fully automatic acquisition of such information. It will be necessary to consider how these issues should be addressed when trying to realize a general-purpose and autonomous artificial researcher.

% \textcolor{red}{TODO: May not be here}

\subsection{Literacy}

It is not an exaggeration to say that language is one of the most significant features that sets humans apart from other animals. In human society, I express considerably large amount of information through language. When I consider the impact brought about by recent language models, I can understand just how significant language is to us.

The ability to handle language, or \textit{literacy}, is essential for communicating research findings in human society. This is because, in human society, knowledge is also conveyed in the form of written documents, particularly academic papers. The ability to handle language can be broadly categorized into \textit{reading} and \textit{writing} texts. The former is necessary for extracting desired information from research papers and the later is necessary for representing the research outcome as a knowledge in a society.

It is fair to say that until recently, one of the number one barriers to research automation was acquiring this ability to handle language. However, this situation has drastically changed in recent years with the remarkable success of large-scale language models. The development of large-scale language models has largely removed the technical difficulties of understanding articles, so that I can now focus on understanding the specifics of the research.

Of course, there is still work to be done to fully understand the language, but the topic of how to acquire language use skills is far beyond the scope of this paper and will not be addressed here. Instead, I will discuss the most important textual data in research: the scholarly articles themselves. This is because being able to read and write well in research cannot be discussed without an understanding of what a scholarly article is about. After that, I will examine the implications it brings to research automation.

% Therefore, in this section, I would like to discuss what a research paper is and what constitutes a good research paper. Then, I will examine the implications it brings to research conducted with AI.

% \subsubsection{Reading}
% As previously mentioned, acquiring information from academic papers is a fundamental task necessary in all aspects of research.

% In particular, there may be cases where one does not even know where to find the necessary knowledge. Therefore, in order to obtain the required information, it is necessary to first search for the academic papers themselves where the information is stored. 
% Additionally, researchers sometimes have to compare multiple papers. Researchers need to demonstrate in the paper that the problem they are trying to solve is truly unknown, and that their proposal is truly novel.

% A survey combines all of these tasks. In other words, it is the process of information retrieval and extraction from multiple academic papers followed by decision-making.
\subsubsection{Characteristics of Research Paper}
An academic paper is a structured document that summarizes research procedures and findings. It is said to have originated around the 17th century but became more common in the 19th century. To read a research paper effectively or write a good research paper, it is crucial to first consider the role that a paper should fulfill. 

Above all, a research paper is an expression of knowledge. It serves as a kind of ``asset'' for humanity, where new knowledge is generated based on the knowledge. Therefore, it is expected to possess information related to knowledge production in as detailed and accurate a manner as possible.

Furthermore, since knowledge is intended to be used by third parties, a research paper always assumes the presence of a reader. Therefore, it is necessary for the paper to be easily understandable, which means it should have a low information acquisition cost. For instance, during peer review, clarity and delivery are evaluated, focusing on the value of the paper as a ``report'' of knowledge rather than the knowledge itself. One of the attempts to enhance comprehensibility is through the structure of the paper. The prevalence of structured papers as I know them today seems to have emerged in the 20th century \cite{harmon1989structure}. 
The structure of a research paper varies depending on the field, but in empirical scientific papers, a widely adopted format is known as IMRaD, which stands for Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion can be interpreted as having roles that express what questions were studied, how those questions were investigated, what discoveries were made, and what the significance of those discoveries is, respectively \cite{gastel2022write}.

Moreover, the social aspects can also influence the content of a research paper. For example, in the current academic community, emphasis is placed on publishing papers in top journals or getting papers accepted at top conferences. These factors are not only important for the researcher's reputation but also crucial for securing academic positions in a highly competitive job market. Due to these pressures, it is said that the motivation to present research findings attractively can lead to distortions in the content of the research or make it less comprehensible. In the sense of making the results more appealing, a research paper could be likened to a kind of ``artwork''.

\subsubsection{Implications for Autonomous Research}
Having provided an overview of academic papers, I would like to take this opportunity to express our opinion on the significance of literacy when conducting research with AI. First and foremost, it is important to note that literacy is merely a means for information acquisition and expression in the context of knowledge production. Therefore, effective reading of a research paper depends on the manner in which the paper is presented, and writing a good research paper relies on determining the most valuable expression of knowledge in relation to the specific use case. Note that the term ``valuable'' here refers to non-epistemic value rather than epistemic value.

In the previous section, I provided an overview of the various roles that research papers fulfill. Among them, I believe that the role of knowledge representation remains significant regardless of whether the producer of knowledge is human or machine, depending on the context. In other words, information such as research questions, hypotheses, experimental designs, and results will continue to be expressed. When considering machine readers, it is possible that there will be an increased demand for or capability to provide more detailed information or information closer to raw data.

Next, let's discuss clarity. Clarity is a relative concept that pertains to the reader. Traditionally, research papers have been designed for human researchers as the intended audience. However, if I shift the assumption to machine readers, the value of clarity in papers as perceived by humans is likely to undergo transformation. For instance, the IMRaD structure has historically evolved to make it more comprehensible for humans. However, whether this structure is optimal as an information source for machines may need to be reconsidered. Even without waiting for complete automation, there has been rapid development in language models using question-and-answer formats for extracting information from unstructured documents. Considering this, it may become more important to provide comprehensive and accurate information rather than devising structures that are simply easy to read.

\subsubsection{Towards a Better Representation of Knowledge}
The trend toward creating artificial intelligence that has acquired knowledge of a large number of papers will further accelerate in the future. The problems I face today may eventually be solved, and it may be able to understand the contents of a vast number of academic papers almost perfectly. 

The problem will be that academic papers do not represent all the information in the research process. For example, I take considerable pains in our research to construct questions and hypotheses, but information about the process of generating them is not often written in the papers. The process of verification is described in much more detail than other processes, but even then there is often tacit knowledge that is not documented in the paper. Also, the papers do not present the process of knowledge production in chronological order as it is, but rather reorganize and recapitulate it in an easy-to-understand manner so that it is compelling to the reader \cite{schickore2008doing}. For example, it is often said that the process of building up a mathematical proof is different from the actual proof flow described in the paper. 

This may not be a problem for those who obtain only fragmentary information from the paper, but it becomes a problem when the paper is regarded as data for learning the knowledge production process. Thus, as long as I follow the current format of papers, the format may constrain what artificial intelligence can do. If this is the case, then perhaps I should adapt the form of representation of scholarly output itself to the machine. In particular, it will be even more important in the future to stock as much raw data of the research process as possible. If this can be achieved, large-scale artificial intelligence may be able to learn data-driven knowledge production, rather than merely overview knowledge of research.

It would not be realistic to suddenly abandon the current format of the dissertation. Rather, what I should do is first keep a raw log of the research process as much as possible. Then, separate the data of the research process from the final expression of the thesis. The dissertation should be positioned as an expression of one of these logs of the research process. This will allow us to accumulate richer machine-accessible data on the research process while preserving the current form of the thesis.

% While academic papers are already structured into sections such as introduction, method, results, discussion, and conclusion, I believe that further sub-structuring of these sections could make it easier for readers to gather information. For example, the introduction section contains a broad range of elements, but breaking it down into more detailed subheadings could help readers more easily access the information they need.

% There are various techniques for writing academic papers, but they are all designed with the assumption that humans will be reading the paper. Papers are considered to be ``reports'' and are expected to provide information to readers at a low cost. Additionally, papers are usually peer-reviewed and published in academic journals, so it is necessary to write attractive and engaging papers that will be accepted by the best journals. In this sense, papers are also ``works of art.'' However, I believe that the essential nature of papers lies in their role as the foundation of knowledge production, making papers an asset in terms of their ``knowledge'' aspect.


\subsection{Data Analysis}
A considerable amount of research is empirical in nature, meaning that it involves inductive reasoning supported by some form of evidence rather than relying solely on complete deduction. Therefore, although the quantity, quality, and characteristics may vary, these studies all generate some kind of data. Consequently, the techniques for analyzing this data are recognized as crucial across a wide range of research domains, regardless of the specific field. \textcolor{red}{TODO: add discussion about data analysis itself}

Please note that when I talk about data analysis, I are not limiting it to any specific operation on the data. In other words, it could involve generating hypotheses from data, testing hypotheses, or conducting verification. Descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and predictive statistics are all encompassed within data analysis.

We have extensively discussed inductive reasoning so far, and since statistical machine learning itself is data analysis, there may be no need to dedicate a separate chapter for its explanation. However, I chose to include this chapter because in the research process, discussions often separate data generation through experiments from the analysis of that data. In our understanding, both data generation through experiments and data analysis are two distinct tasks within the function of, for example, verification. By emphasizing that data analysis is a task to achieve that goal, I believe it makes our position more understandable. 

You may raise doubts about the validity of categorizing the research process into a unidirectional ``research process'' by pointing out that in a single experiment, the same data can be used for both verification and generating new hypotheses, reflecting the trial-and-error nature of actual research. However, as I emphasized earlier, what is important is not the chronological sequence but the role that each process plays in knowledge production. According to our organization, even if the same data is used, if it is used for verification, it is considered verification, and if it is used for generating the next hypothesis, it is considered hypothesis generation for the next study. Emphasizing that data analysis itself is a technique that does not have a meaning beyond manipulating the data helps convey our understanding that its relevance to knowledge production is relatively determined by how it is used in different knowledge production processes.

\subsection{Deductive System}
Up until now, I have primarily discussed inductive reasoning, but deductive systems such as logic and mathematics are indispensable and highly significant in research. Deduction is a logical reasoning method that derives conclusions from premises in such a way that the conclusion necessarily follows if the premises are accepted. It is said to guarantee truth-preservation because if the assumptions are true, the conclusion is guaranteed to be true. So far, it has been mentioned that it is ultimately impossible to prove the truth or falsehood of a hypothesis through empirical methods. In contrast, deduction is an extremely powerful method of verification because it can prove the truth or falsehood of a hypothesis. Furthermore, regardless of how counterintuitive the conclusion may be, if the premises are accepted and the inference rules are applied appropriately, I must accept the conclusion. In this sense, deduction allows us to think about the world free from human intuition and cognitive biases, making it a very powerful means of understanding the nature.

\subsubsection{Mathematics}
Mathematics has played an essential role in knowledge production, particularly in the field of natural sciences. There are various opinions on why mathematics is crucial in the realm of natural sciences. Firstly, as mentioned earlier, one reason is its deductive nature. As repeatedly stated, knowledge production involves accumulating evidences of belief in the face of the unknown. Conclusions derived through truth-preserving deduction immediately provide beliefs of the same strength as the premises, thus playing a vital role in unraveling the unknown. 

Secondly, mathematics is rigorous. While natural languages rely on context and often contain ambiguity, mathematics provides a precise and unambiguous means of representing and communicating knowledge. It has served as the language of science, playing a significant role in scientific discourse.

Thirdly, mathematics (and more broadly deductive systems) is debuggable. As emphasized in the hypothesis generation and hypothesis verification sections, in mathematics all assumptions are explicitly stated. Thus, the causes of the results of a deduction can be reduced to a matter of comparison among a finite number of elements.

Lastly, mathematics is abstract. From the ancient time, even in the absence of formal deduction, mathematics dealt with the concepts such as numbers, which is greatly abstract concept of great interest to humans \cite{david2010history}. Through the introduction of symbolic representation and manipulation, mathematics has been further enhanced in its abstract nature. Moreover, mathematics not only abstracts reality but also engages in a cycle of further abstraction. By repeatedly abstracting the abstracted, it has constructed highly abstract systems \cite{bochner1968role}. Abstraction involves extracting only partial common properties of objects, and it is closely related to understanding, generating more universal knowledge. Additionally, through the premises established by abstract concepts, further deductions lead to a broader understanding of the world \cite{heisenberg2008abstraction}. I believe these characteristics make mathematics an indispensable part of knowledge production. 

Thus, the ability to utilize deductive systems is extremely important in expanding the realm of practically discoverable knowledge. Therefore, when it comes to achieving intelligence capable of autonomous research, it becomes crucial to consider how to construct new deductive systems or at least enable the utilization of existing deductive systems.

\subsection{Behavior}
Finally, although this is not a technique, let us stress the importance of being able to behave freely. As I repeatedly emphasized in the section of verification instantiation, acquiring the ability to act freely is essential to truly achieve a general and autonomous artificial researcher. This means that if the research is completed within the computers, the researcher can perform any operation on the computers at will, and if the research occurs within the real world, the researcher can handle all four limbs at will, just like a human being.

\subsubsection{Behavior in computers}
In recent years, research has emerged that aims to enable operations on computerss to be performed in natural language. For example, a language model is being developed that will allow a user to operate a browser like a human being by receiving instructions in natural language \cite{nakano2021webgpt}. Although currently limited to browser operations, this is a framework that can be extended to any behavior on a computers in the future. Research is also underway to automate code generation and execution, which will be an important elemental technology for automating many actions on the computers \cite{gulwani2017program}. Finally, research on using tools for language models \cite{mialon2023augmented} will also aid in the acquisition of actions on the computers. This is because once browser operations and code generation become highly automated, it is expected that calling those language models as tools will allow them to automatically perform fairly complex and sophisticated actions on the computers. Therefore, it seems very important that these technologies, which are currently being actively studied in the machine learning research community, continue to develop in order to realize general-purpose and autonomous artificial researchers.

\subsubsection{Behavior in Real World}
The development of robots that move like humans has been an active area of research. I believe that the development of robots that move like humans and animals, such as those being developed by Boston Dynamics \cite{kuindersma2016optimization}, will be essential to the future automation of these general-purpose, autonomous studies. More directly related to research, our efforts in the field of laboratory automation, which aims to automate experiments, is precisely the area in which I have seriously considered automating research, including such real-world behaviors. In particular, the development of a research specialized general-purpose humanoid robot (\textit{LabDroid}) like ``Mahoro'' \cite{yachie2017robotic} is a powerful step in this direction. As LabDroid becomes more versatile, I will move closer to achieving general-purpose research automation.

\chapter{Additional Literature}

\section{Scholarly Document Processing}
\label{appendix:scholarly-document-processing}
\textit{Scholarly document processing} is a general term for research on automated processing related to scholarly articles and has been studied as part of natural language processing, text mining, and information retrieval.
\subsubsection{Search}
Firstly, let us mention academic search engines that provide features to help researchers find relevant papers from a vast amount of literature \cite{googlescholar,semanticscholar,dblp,pubmed,citeseerx}. 
Specialized search systems have also been proposed for specific purposes. For example, some studies have been proposed systems to discover studis in other domeins \cite{kang2022augmenting}, difficulties, limitations and emerging hypotheses \cite{lahav2022search}, and author homepages \cite{patel2021author}. Also, in response to the COVID pandemic, several systems have emerged in recent times to search for COVID-19 related papers \cite{hope2020scisight}.
Instead of searching for papers manually, there are approaches that directly recommend papers to researchers. In practice, it is common for the specific aspects of academic papers that researchers want to compare to vary depending on the situation and research field. Therefore, researchers have invented the method allowing comparison in certain aspect of papers \cite{ostendorff2020aspect} and tailored to some particular research area \cite{breitinger2022recommending}. Also, some researchers study recommendation of authors instead of papers \cite{portenoy2022bursting}. A comprehensive summary of classical research on paper recommendation can be found in \cite{bai2019scientific}.
\subsubsection{Read}
The majority of research on automation in research pertains to automating operations related to papers. Specifically, research on information extraction from papers constitutes the majority. Here, \textit{reading} refers to extracting information from a paper.
Several methods specialized in extracting specific information have been proposed. For instance, there are studies for extracting mathematical expressions \cite{greiner2020math,madisetty2021neural}, measure \cite{harper2021semeval,kohler2021s}, tabale and figure \cite{shen2022vila,hashmi2021current,zhuang2022resel,yamamoto2021visual}, dataset \cite{hou2019identification,kumar2021dataquest,prasad2019dataset}, and results \cite{kardas2020axcell}.
There are also studies that focus not on information extraction, but on determining the meaning of sentences written in papers. One representative example is research on citation classification, which involves understanding the intent behind the cited text \cite{pride2019act,kunnath2021meta,kunnath2022dynamic,kunnath2022act2,lauscher2021multicite}. Another example is topic/theme classification, which detect the main topic of the paper \cite{sadat2022hierarchical,mendoza2022benchmark,salatino2022cso}.
One of the most heavily researched areas of information extraction from scientific papers is summarization. Some studies propose methods to generate the contribution of a paper \cite{hayashi2020s}, scientific claims \cite{wright2022generating}, and lay summarization \cite{goldsack2022making}. Other studies have attempted to create better paper summaries using citation graph \cite{chen2022scientific,an2021enhancing}, or propose the summarization system \cite{erera2019summarization}.
Many of the earlier summarization studies only used limited information such as abstracts. In recent years, there have been proposed studies that generate summaries by reading the entire paper \cite{subramanian2019extractive,qi2022sapgraph,dong2020discourse,tretyak2020combination}.
Also, the number of papers has increased dramatically, and the time available for obtaining information from a single paper has become increasingly limited. Thus, some studies propose the methods to generate extremely short summaries, such as TLDR \cite{cachola2020tldr} and key phrases \cite{boudin2021keyphrase,garg2021keyphrase}.
To advance these summarization studies, some studies propose datasets \cite{yasunaga2019scisummnet,bastan2022sume} and annotation platforms \cite{el2022platform} for paper summarization. 
The early research on paper summarization, which was conducted relatively early, is well summarized in \cite{altmami2022automatic}. If you are interested, please also refer to this paper.
Up to this point, I have described methods that assume extracting specific information or summarizing papers. In contrast, there are studies that issue queries in natural language to retrieve desired information from papers. This has been formalized as a question-answering task, a more general problem setting \cite{lu2022learn,ruggeri2022argscichat,saikh2022scienceqa}. 
In the field of question-answering for academic papers, some web services have gained attention for its high performance \cite{elicit,scispace}. Elicit use large language models and compose them to write \textit{compositional language model programs}. Ought \cite{ought}, the provider of Elicit, publish the instructions of how to write compositional language model programs \cite{primer2022}. Also, they disclose how to update their system with their idea of \textit{process supervision} \cite{reppert2023iterated}. Therefore, for those who are interested in question-answering systems for scientific papers, I strongly recommend reading these papers and documents.
Lastly, many tools have been proposed to assist researchers in reading papers. These studies highlight rhetorical roles \cite{fok2023scim,lauscher2018arguminsci}, generate description to terminologies \cite{august2022generating,head2021augmenting,murthy2022accord}, simplify texts for non-experts \cite{august2022paper,jeblick2022chatgpt}, and allow interaction \cite{kang2022threddy,elicit,scispace}.
\subsubsection{Write}
Research is the act of producing a novel knowledge on top of prior studies. The apt incorporation of previous literature and elucidation of the distinctions between the proposition and previous studies are essential. Consequently, some researchers have investigated to generate comparative arguments \cite{yu2022scientific} and others have studied to generate citation texts \cite{arita2022citation,gu2022controllable,wang2021autocite,xing2020automatic,funkquist2022citebench}. Additionally, several studies exist that, instead of directly producing text, aspire to assist in the writing process by recommending relevant literature for inclusion as citations \cite{farber2020citation,zhang2020dual,duma2019contextual,farber2018cite,gosangi2021use}. Furthermore, there exist investigations aimed at automating systematic reviews writing \cite{dones2022systematic}.
Scholarly articles are structured documents. This structural property enables researchers to generate texts per sections. Thereafter, 
researchers have endeavored to generate, for example, abstract \cite{kumarasinghe2022automatic,gao2022comparing,wang2019paperrobot}, related works \cite{li2022automatic,shah2021generating,liu2023causal}, table description in result section \cite{moosavi2021scigen,moosavi2021learning}, conclusion, and future work \cite{wang2019paperrobot}. Wang et al. propose to generate even next research's probable title \cite{wang2019paperrobot}.

\chapter{Alignment}
Understanding is subjective, so there is a need to consider alignment. Even if the process of hypothesis generation is incomprehensible to humans, as long as the verification is connected to fundamental human beliefs, it can be said to be knowledge based on a common foundation with humans.

\chapter{Research Optimization}

\chapter{Research as Social Activity}
In this paper, I will discuss automation focused on the unique elements of knowledge production as mentioned above. However, research is a social endeavor. And that society has various levels, such as research labs, universities, and research ecosystems. Therefore, if I think about optimizing the whole activity of research, I need to think about optimizing these wholes. Although it is out of the scope of this paper and therefore not discussed this time, I would like to discuss this in the future.

\chapter{Research as Belief Update}

From the perspective that research is belief updating, the roles of question construction, hypothesis generation, and hypothesis verification can be represented in the following Fig. \ref{fig:beliefupdate}. 
\begin{figure}[htb]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figs/beliefupdate.jpg}
    \caption{Research Process as Belief Update}
    \label{fig:beliefupdate}
\end{figure}
In the diagram, circles represent statements, and squares represent beliefs in response to those statements. Note that while circles were described as statements, they are not limited to textual representations as long as they are associated with beliefs. Beliefs are determined by the subject holding the belief (in this case, an agent) and the object of the belief (the statement), but please note that I are assuming a fixed agent in this context.

Firstly, in this world, there exist countless pairs of statements and corresponding beliefs (or latent beliefs). Posing a question corresponds to extracting a subset of unknown statements from this pool. More precisely, an unknown statement refers to a statement for which the agent is unsure whether to assign a strong or weak belief. Choosing corresponds to implicitly determining a function that assigns beliefs to each statement. For example, let's consider posing the question ``When did the universe begin?'' This answer to this question is unknown to humanity. By posing this question, the range of possible answers is narrowed down. However, it is not realistically possible for an agent to be aware of all statements and potential answers that could exist. Therefore, while I mentioned pairs of beliefs and statements, please consider that most of these beliefs are latent and potential.

Next, generating a hypothesis involves selecting one pair of a claim and a belief from among the potential claims that could serve as potential answers to the question. It is at this point, by choosing a hypothesis or considering multiple candidate hypotheses, that discourse becomes consciously acknowledged, and beliefs are substantively assigned. Finally, as I discussed in Chapter 2, verification involves gaining evidence for the belief in the chosen hypothesis, resulting in the updating of the belief state. The updated beliefs are represented in black in the diagram.
